# The course

## Advanced data analysis for psychological science

\fontsize{7.5pt}{12}\selectfont
This course aims at providing basic notions of **multi-level & multi-variate** linear regression modeling, focusing on applications in developmental, educational, and applied psychology. \newline

The course aims at transmitting **basic knowledge** on *linear mixed-effects regression* (LMER) and two common examples of multivariate techniques within the structural equation modeling (SEM) framework, namely *path analysis* & *confirmatory factor analysis* (CFA). \newline

The course also aims at providing **practical competences** on advanced data analysis, with a particular emphasis on data preparation and pre-processing, model fit and evaluation, coefficient interpretation, and data visualization. Also, we'll try to **understand the results reported in published papers**. \newline

The course is characterized by an **applied approach** that prioritizes real case studies and includes **practical exercises** (optional) using R.

## Prerequisites

\fontsize{9.5pt}{12}\selectfont
Students should have good knowledge about basic concepts linked to probability theory and associated topics (e.g., random variables, probability distributions, hypothesis testing), including **linear regression modeling** (but we will review that).

`R` is a programming language and a programming environment for **statistical computing** and **graphics**. \newline

It is based on the `S` language (Becker & Chambers, 1984), subsequently used to develop the `S-Plus` sofware and then `R`, originally created in 1996 by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman. \newline

  \endcol

R provides a wide range of statistical and graphical techniques. It is designed to be **user-friendly** but at the same time to generate **high-quality outputs** (graphics, tables, and reports with equations, mathematical symbols, etc.). \newline

Differently from other statistical software that implement multilevel and multivariate analyses (e.g., Mplus), R is a **free sofware** (GNU General Public Licence) that can be used anywhere worldwide, it is an **open-source software** (all functions are documented and can be inspected in detail), and **works on all main OS**: Windows, MacOS, and UNIX (e.g. Linux)

- interpretation of data analysis outputs

- interpretation of paper results \newline

__Exam contents__: The contents required by the exam are \color{red} exhaustively covered in the [main course slides](#slides)\color{black}. Note that the required contents \color{red} will depend on where we arrive \color{black} at the end of the course \newline \color{black}

__Exam scores__: The exam score will be computed as the sum of the scores obtained to the 31 questions (right answer = 1; wrong/missing answer = 0; \newline 18+ right answers = exam passed; 31 right answers = 30 cum laude). \newline

## Linear models as the common root

\fontsize{7pt}{12}\selectfont 
**Linear regression models** allow to determinate the link between two variables \newline as expressed by a linear function: \fontsize{10pt}{12}\selectfont \color{violet} $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i$ \fontsize{7pt}{12}\selectfont \color{black} 

Such a function can be graphically represented as a **straight line** where \newline \color{violet} $\beta_0$ \color{black} is the **intercept** (value assumed by `y` when `x` = 0) \newline \color{violet} $\beta_1$ \color{black} is the  **slope** (predicted change in `y` when `x` increases by 1 unit) \newline \color{violet} $\epsilon_i$ \color{black} is the **error** (distance between observation *i* and the regression line) 

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.width=4,fig.height=2,out.width="200px",fig.align='center'}
par(mar=c(0, 4, 0, 2) + 0.1,mai = c(0.8, 0.7, 0, 0.7))
x <- rnorm(n = 100)
y <- x + rnorm(n = 100)
plot(y~x,pch=19,col="gray",cex=0.8)
abline(lm(y~x),col="red",lwd=2)
abline(v=0,lty=2,col="gray")
abline(h=summary(lm(y~x))$coefficients[1,1],lty=2,col="gray")
text(x=0.5,y=summary(lm(y~x))$coefficients[1,1],labels=paste("B0 =",round(summary(lm(y~x))$coefficients[1,1],2)))
text(x=min(x)+0.5,y=min(y)+0.5,labels=paste("B1 =",round(summary(lm(y~x))$coefficients[2,1],2)))
```

## The only three formulas to keep in mind

\begincols
  \begincol{.5\textwidth}

\fontsize{10pt}{12}\selectfont Linear model: \newline \newline \color{violet} $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i$ \fontsize{7pt}{12}\selectfont \color{black} \newline \newline

\fontsize{10pt}{12}\selectfont Mixed-effects model: \newline \newline  \color{violet} $y_{ij} = (\beta_{00} + \lambda_{0j}) + (\beta_{10} + \lambda_{1j})x + \epsilon_{ij}$ \fontsize{7pt}{12}\selectfont \color{black}

For each observation $i$ and each cluster $j$, the intercept and the slope are decomposed into the **fixed** components \color{violet} $\beta_0$ \color{black} and \color{violet} $\beta_1$ \color{black} referred to the whole sample, and the **random** components \color{violet} $\lambda_{0j}$ \color{black} and  \color{violet}$\lambda_{1j}$ \color{black} randomly varying between clusters \color{black}

  \endcol
\begincol{.5\textwidth}

\fontsize{10pt}{12}\selectfont Structural equation model:\fontsize{9pt}{12}\selectfont \color{violet} $$ \begin{cases} y = \Lambda\eta + \epsilon \ \color{black}  (measurement) \\\\ \eta = B\eta^* + \zeta \ \color{black}  (structural) \end{cases} $$ \fontsize{7pt}{12}\selectfont \color{black}

The **measurement model** clarifies the relationships \color{violet} $\Lambda$ \color{black} between \newline the *observed variables* \color{violet} $y$ \color{black} and the corresponding *latent variables* \color{violet} $\eta$\color{black}, \newline whereas the **structural model** clarifies the relationship \color{violet} $B$ \color{black} between two or more latent variables \color{violet} $\eta^*$.

**Between & Within** \newline \fontsize{7pt}{12}\selectfont
When a random variable $y$ is measured from multiple data points per subject (or group), multilevel modeling **partition the $y$ variance** into the *within-subject* (level 1) & *between-subject* (level 2) components. \newline The same applyes when multiple individuals (e.g., students) are nested within a number of groups (e.g., schools) &rightarrow; *within-group* vs. *between-group*
```{r , echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.width=9,fig.height=2.6,fig.align='center'}
df <- data.frame(Subject = as.factor(c(rep("S01",6),rep("S02",6))),
                 time = rep(1:6,2),
                 Work.Stress = c(2,1,3,4,3,2,   6,6,3,7,6,6))
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(df,aes(x=time,y=Work.Stress,color=Subject)) + 
  geom_smooth(lwd=1.2,se=FALSE) + geom_point(cex=3) + ylim(0,8) +

## Multilevel models: Fixed vs. Random effects

\fontsize{8pt}{12}\selectfont
In the literature, multilevel modeling is sometimes called with different terms, \newline \fontsize{6pt}{12}\selectfont e.g., *hierarchical linear modeling*, *random slope models*, *variance component models*, ... \newline

\fontsize{8pt}{12}\selectfont
All these models are part of the broader \color{violet} \fontsize{9pt}{12}\selectfont __*mixed-effects models*__ \color{black} \fontsize{8pt}{12}\selectfont family, \newline identifying models with both fixed and random effects:

- **Fixed effects**: effects that remains constant across all clusters, whose *levels* are exhaustively considered (e.g., gender, levels of a Likert scale) and generally controlled by the researcher (e.g., experimental conditions) \newline

- **Random effects**: effects that vary from cluster to cluster, whose *levels* are randomly sampled from a population (e.g., schools, participants, days, experimental stimuli)

**Linear regression**: determining the link between a dependent and an independent variables through linear functions like: $y = \beta_1x_{1} + \beta_2X_{2} + \epsilon$ \newline
```{r echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
